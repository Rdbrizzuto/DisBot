# DisBot

A simple Discord Bot. If a member of the server mentions water/thirst in chat then the bot reminds you to drink your water!
It also has a 20% chance of leaving a positive comment on any message in chat. 

To run this BOT, a discord API token will need to be generated and inserted into the code, and the bot will need to be added to your discord server.
Once those steps are comlpete, simply type "python3 main.py" into your command line (while being in the same directory as that file), and the bot should appear as "online" in discord.
